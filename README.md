# APIWordCloudR

This beyond session gives an example of connecting to an Application Program Interface (API) to obtain data and create a basic world cloud. APIs are often a scary topic that may seem overwhelming. Really an API is just a communication protocol for common tasks such as downloading data or creating predictions from a model. Code will be given on how to use R packages to obtain data from an open API and easily tokenize the data in order to easily create fun word clouds! The topics covered in the session lend themselves to downloading data from other sources such as stock data or health record data.
